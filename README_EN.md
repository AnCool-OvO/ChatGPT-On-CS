# Lazy customer service   
**English** · [中文](README_CN.md) 

This project is an intelligent customer service tool based on large models, supporting access to platforms such as WeChat, Taobao, Bilibili, Douyin Enterprise Account, Douyin, Douyin Store, Weibo Chat, Xiaohongshu Professional Account Operation, Xiaohongshu, Zhihu, etc. It can choose GPT3.5/GPT4.0 (more platforms will be supported in the future), handle text, voice, and images, access external resources such as operating systems and the Internet through plugins, and support customization of enterprise AI applications based on its own knowledge base.

**Note** : This project is just a customer service tool for connecting to external platforms and does not provide any platform accounts, which need to be prepared by yourself. Additionally, the knowledge base function also needs to be prepared by yourself. Currently, this project only supports integration with OpenAI's API interface (or proxy).
